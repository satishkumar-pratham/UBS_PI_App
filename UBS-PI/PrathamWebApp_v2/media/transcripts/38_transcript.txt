Hello, my name is Rutuja Shanbhag and currently I am a first year biomedical engineering student from DY Patil University at a Kodi. So my dreams are 2. My dream is to become a biomedical engineer because it's my fashion so that I can.Learn both engineering and medical too, because my dream is to become my dream is post to be to career mind in medical field. But due to some issues and all I couldn't do it. So I will. And so this was the option in front of me and that's why I choose to become a biomedical engineer. There are lot many hobbies of mind in few hours. For example I love poo teach.I love to dance. I love to play music. I love to roam around and meet new strangers and have and talk with them. And if I am, I love to do such things because when I talk to other strangers so that I can play, I can. I can free up myself in front of all those strangers I can. I can.I can, I will not feel lonely and that's why I love to talk with people and mostly with strangers and my like. I told you my hobbies to teach. I love to teach others means of any topic. And earlier I used to take tuition. I was 2.I used to teach all the students in that, in in tuition and later on due to some results it got a.Regards, the tuition was over, but later on though, because of Pratham Foundation, I got to know that there was an opportunity to be a volunteer and handle 5 minutes in our community under us. So I prefer I was like I was into Zee Astic to become a volunteer and I got to know that being a volunteer its a very its very compulsory to guide all the students and it was a very nice task for me to guide all these thrills.In my community and I used to take the students, tell them how to speak, like how to slide. There was schools in tab seek, read an speak apps Uday. So I used to tell them like we have to do this and I used to guide them and I love doing that and secondly being when I I came in Pratham one year ago like one and half year ago.And it is nice experience working with Pratham. And firstly when I was a volunteer, are you speaking that being a volunteer is just to handle kids? 5 kids in in my community but its not like that. I used later when I became old. Problem I I find that there are many opposite of volunteers.They can.Daab the there were many forces held for volunteers, for example personal development, upcycling course, beauty course, and when during lock down deep. I attended the personality development course and so that I came to know about myself more clearly. I build my own confidence and I was. I was like I.Found that there are many, many such new things I want to overcome of so I I got to know about like how to speak in an interview, how to dress the file giving an interview, and how to how to deal with myself and dealing with our service. Such a big deal.So thats the most interesting most important thing I learnt. Facility develop course and secondly I also learn how to code like for example there was a there was a program of scratch good in that they use 15th or teachers. How to code? How to make programs? How to give the characters is priced the major role? How to how to make the emotions and all and they this help me a lot. King engineers help me a lot.In my program in my programming lectures and all, and being a girl, it's most important for every girl to glow in the way like there are many problems like because of face and there was held beautiful where I attended. I love tomato facial, how to like? They gave small small tips, many of many other volunteers to. Well, girls were asking all the questions how to sharing the problem.And they were even all the solution for the problems. And for me like every girl want herself to glow in front of the walls of being a girl. I love that I love to attend beauty course. They gave small tips like whom, how to glow in home with small small stepson on so. And this was the main help and love the most provided us many materials.By which they help us personally. For personally I got help with those tabs and Raspberry Pi as the firstly the tabs ball details was given tapos. Given all these small childrens but later on I used it for myself also for for like for getting for girls, for researching, for with the help of router, for researching for.For clearly fine, for clarifying my doubts and all, and then during my 12th HSC board exam I was having many issues with my mobile. For the there was Raspberry Pi with me and help me a lot. I I used to watch videos I used to solve questions in Raspberry Pi with the help of Google and also material Leo's materially rasam. Help me a lot. I would thank Pratham.For this, thank you.
